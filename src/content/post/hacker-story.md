Ask yourself:

- What are the most repetitive parts of my current job?
- Who are the people in my life with knowledge in this area?

Potential things to learn can fall into a few categories:

- This is useful to my current situation
- I enjoy this
- I know people that can help me with this
- This will be useful in the future

Find things that are at the intersection of these categories. For example, maybe you have some
repetitive manual task at your current job that could be automated with bash or
python. Maybe you collaborate with colleagues on text documents and you're frustrated
with emailing different versions back and forth as email attachments; GitHub is
perfect for this.

Here are a few things that I think are useful for most people who use computers:

- git
- bash
- python
- basic HTML/CSS

## First projects

Building a simple personal website from scratch in HTML is a great way to get
started. Keep it simple. I recommend [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).

### Deployment

Once you have a basic site, you should learn how to deploy it. Pick a web host
and do it manually at first. Once it gets repetitive, automate it!

### DNS

Pick a cheap domain name and set it up with your website.

### Add tests

Testing is extremely valuable. Figure out how to test your setup in a basic way.
